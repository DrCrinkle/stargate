# Windows Installation Troubleshooting
This document describes how to deal with various Windows issues regarding
the installation of Stargate DAW.

# Windows "Smart Screen" Warnings
Click "More Info" and "Install Anyway".  This screen is designed to scare users
and force developers to buy an expensive code signing certificate to make the
errors go away.  Literally every installer that does not show this message has
paid the money to a Microsoft "partner".

# Portable install mode
If you would like to install Stargate DAW for Windows to a flash drive, or you
just want to store your projects and configurations next to the installation,
select the "Portable flash drive install" option from the installer, and most
likely you want to uncheck the "Start Menu Shortcut" feature.  Note that the
MacOS app bundles can be installed alongside a Windows portable install (at the
time of this writing, there is no universal portable Linux install yet).
